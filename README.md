# Smoke-Detector
Smoke detector has been reviewed as a fundamental component of active fire detection strategy of modern commercial and residential building.
In the 1970â€™s, industries recorded increased use of smoke detectors and this growth was accompanied by several significant research projects
that reinforced the life safety protection provided by smoke detectors, thereby providing significant evidence that supported increase in use
of smoke detectors. Also, in order to understand the response, working principle of these detectors in the environment, several researches
were embarked. Accurate prediction of smoke detector is a very significant way of assessing detector system performance because occupants and
fire service notification can be dependent upon smoke detector response. Fire Dynamic Simulator software, can be used to predict the response of smoke detector.
A smoke detector is a device that senses smoke, typically as an indicator of fire. It may issue a signal to a fire alarm control panel as part of fire alarm system. 
Smoke can be detected either optically (photoelectric) or by physical process(ionization). 
Smoke detectors have prior detection when compared with heat detectors, hence are preferred for fire detection. 
They also find application in detecting, and thus deter smoking in premises where it is banned.
Once there a fire, the fire detection system activates the alert thereby triggering the automatic sprinkler system.
Researchers have been studying fire taking place in various places such as residential area and commercial buildings
